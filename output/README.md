# Output directory for analysis scripts

Note: this directory should contain output that is created in the pyaerocom analysis (
cf. [ANALYSIS_SCRIPT.py](https://github.com/metno/pyaerocom-synthesis/blob/master/ANALYSIS_SCRIPT.py)) and NOT output created in the notebooks of this repository. The latter is
supposed to be stored in the *output_notebooks* directory.
